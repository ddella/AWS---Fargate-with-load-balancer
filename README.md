# AWS Fargate with Load Balancer

# Introduction
In this tutorial I will run multiple Docker containers in AWS Fargate with a load balancer.  

# Docker container
I will use my Docker container that I built [here](https://github.com/ddella/PHP8-Nginx). It's a web server based on Nginx [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) and [PHP 8](https://www.php.net/). I have some PHP file that returns information on the server.
